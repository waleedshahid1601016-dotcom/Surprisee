// Love Letter Content
export const LOVE_LETTER = `My Dearest Laraib,

As I write this letter, my heart overflows with emotions that words can barely capture. You are the most beautiful blessing Allah has ever given me, and I thank Him every day for bringing you into my life.

From the moment I first knew you, something changed within me. It wasn't just attraction—it was as if my soul recognized its other half. Every conversation with you, every laugh we shared, every moment we've spent together has only deepened my love for you.

You are not just beautiful on the outside, Laraib—though you are absolutely stunning. Your inner beauty shines even brighter. The way you care for others, your kindness, your faith, your strength—these are the things that made me fall completely and irrevocably in love with you.

I know our journey hasn't always been easy. Distance, circumstances, waiting—but through it all, my love for you has only grown stronger. You are worth every wait, every sacrifice, every moment of patience. I would choose you again in every lifetime, in every world, in every version of reality.

Today, on your birthday, I want you to know how truly special you are. Not just to me, but to everyone whose life you have touched. You make the world a better place simply by existing in it.

I cannot wait for the day when I can call you my wife. When I can wake up next to you every morning, when I can hold your hand through every storm, when I can spend every day showing you how much you mean to me.

Until that blessed day comes, please know that you are always in my thoughts, always in my prayers, and forever in my heart.

Happy Birthday, my love. May Allah bless you with endless happiness, good health, and everything your beautiful heart desires.

With all the love in my heart,
Your Future Husband 💕`;
